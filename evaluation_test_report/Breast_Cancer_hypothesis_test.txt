--------------------------------------------------
Test: Paired t-test
Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean accuracy of the From-Scratch KNN and Scikit-Learn KNN is the same.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The mean accuracy of the two models is different.
Significance Level (alpha): 0.05
--------------------------------------------------

Results:
T-statistic: -0.9494
P-value: 0.3672

Conclusion:
Since the p-value (0.3672) is greater than or equal to alpha (0.05), we FAIL TO REJECT the null hypothesis.
There is no statistically significant difference in performance between the two implementations.
