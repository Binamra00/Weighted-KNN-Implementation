    cross_validation.py
        def cross_validation_split:

            Splits a dataset into k folds for cross-validation, ensuring all data is used.

            This implementation first shuffles the dataset to remove any ordering bias.
            It then calculates the size of each fold and distributes any remainder
            items one by one to the first few folds.

            Args:
                dataset (list): The dataset to be split.
                k_folds (int): The number of folds to create.

            Returns:
                list: A list of folds, where each fold is a subset of the dataset.

        def accuracy_metric:

            Calculates the accuracy percentage between two lists of labels.

            Args:
                actual (list): A list of true class labels.
                predicted (list): A list of predicted class labels.

            2. Splits the data into 10 folds using our from-scratch implementation.
            3. Runs 10-fold CV for our from-scratch KNN implementation.
            4. Runs 10-fold CV for the Scikit-Learn KNN implementation on the same folds.
            5. Performs a paired t-test on the accuracy scores.
            6. Generates and saves a detailed comparison report.
            7. Generates and saves a hypothesis test report.

            Args:
                config (dict): The configuration dictionary for the dataset.
                test_type (str): The type of hypothesis test to run (currently supports 't-test').
